            <p><b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> is a <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/StyleSheet">stylesheet</a> language used to
                describe the presentation of a document
                written in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a> or <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction">XML</a> (including XML
                dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements
                should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.</p>
            <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C
                specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done
                synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations.</p>
            <p>You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather,
                everything is now CSS without a version number.</p>
            <p>After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different CSS
                modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release recommendations
                separately per module.</p>
            <p>Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a
                snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS
                modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5.</p>

            <p>Our CSS Learning Area features multiple modules that teach CSS from the ground up — no previous knowledge
                required.</p>

                <dt>CSS first steps</dt>
                <dd>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font,
                    color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and
                    other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery
                    with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add
                    styling to HTML.</dd>
                <dd><code>p.a {
                    font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
                  }
                  
                  p.b {
                    font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

                <dd>
                    <p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity with the
                        language and its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, it's time to dive a bit
                        deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have
                        available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.</p>
                    <p>The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand
                        all the essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling and
                        CSS layout.

                    <p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is
                        styling
                        text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS.</p>
                    <p>Here we look at text styling fundamentals,
                        including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text
                        features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling
                        lists and links.</p>

                <dd>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and
                    manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes
                    in the right place in relation to the viewport, and to each other. We have covered the necessary
                    prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern
                    layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might
                    still want to know about. </dd>
